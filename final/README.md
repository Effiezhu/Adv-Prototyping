# COUPLINK - Smart Bracelet for Long-distance Couple

## Introduction 

Couplink is a pair of smart bracelets designed for couples in long-distance relationships. With simple interactions, such as pressing pressure sensor to send thermal feedback and pressing button to send text message and vibration signal, the bracelets aim to bridge the physical gap by facilitating a more intimate and immediate connection between partners, regardless of the distance. For the final design, I removed the vibration motor because it works similarly as the peltier module and will be redundant if I used both. Aside from that, I also designed a more handcraft style fabric bracelet instead of a traditional smartwatch look, so it feels more intimate and warm.

## Implementation   

Explain your process of prototype development including all applicable aspects such as hardware (electronics), firmware (MicroPython code), software (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or other code), integrations (Adafruit IO, IFTTT, etc.), enclosure and mechanical design.  Use a separate subheader for each part:

### Hardware

* 2 of M5Stack ATOMS3 Lite Board
* 2 of M5Stack ATOM TailBat Battery
* 1 pressure sensor
* 1 transistor
* 1 peltier module

### Firmware   

[Server code](https://github.com/Effiezhu/Adv-Prototyping/blob/main/final/server.py)  
[Client code](https://github.com/Effiezhu/Adv-Prototyping/blob/main/final/client.py)

To make the two individual Atoms3 Lite boards communicate with each other, I used one of them as a server and the other board as a client and connected them with bluetooth. I wrote the code in the main.py, so the server board will constantly broadcasting and send the data to the client board. When the client board is connected to the server board, it will constantly looking for data from the server. 

For the server script, it had two input: one is ADC and one is button. Whenever the pressure sensor value is pressed, the server will write a message to the client.  
``` 
  adc_val = adc.read()
  adc_val_8bit = map_value(adc_val, in_min = 0, in_max = 4095,
                           out_min = 0, out_max = 255)
  print('adc value', adc_val_8bit)
  
  # When pressure sensor is pressed, write a message to client
  if adc_val_8bit < 130:
    print('adc value low')
    ble_server.write('low')
    print('write to bleuart..', message)
    time.sleep_ms(2000)
```

When the client receive the message, it will turns on the peltier module for 15 seconds before turning it off.  
``` 
  if(data != ''):
    print('data =', data)
    peltier_timer = time.ticks_ms()
    print('peltier timer', peltier_timer)
    
    control_peltier(True)  # Turn on the Peltier module
  if peltier_timer and time.ticks_ms() >= peltier_timer + 15000:
    print('turn off time is:', time.ticks_ms())
    control_peltier(False)  # Turn off the Peltier module
    peltier_timer = None  # Reset the timer
    
  time.sleep_ms(100)
```

And when the button was pressed, the board will send the data to Adafruit, and IFTTT will send the message to Telegram through Wifi.  
``` 
if BtnA.wasPressed():
    print('button pressed...')
    mqtt_client.publish('Effieee/feeds/button-feed', 'Love you', qos=0)
```

### Enclosure / Mechanical Design   

To make the bracelet cuter and also enclose all the components inside, I chose pink jean fabric, buttons, and cord. I sewed the fabric into a tube, and then attached a button on one side, leaving the side open so the components could be easily taken out to recharge the battery. I sewed the cord on the other side of the tube and closed the side to prevent the components from coming out.

## Project outcome  

As a pair of demo bracelet, they don't have the full functionality to both send and receive messages or signals, but I split the functionality to convey the concept. One bracelet can send messages and send signal to turn on the peltier module, while the other one can receive the thermal feedback.

## Conclusion  

As you wrap up the project, reflect on your experience of creating it.  Use this as an opportunity to mention any discoveries or challenges you came across along the way.  If there is anything you would have done differently, or have a chance to continue the project development given more time or resources, itâ€™s a good way to conclude this section.

During the development process, I first tried laser cut for the enclosure, but I realized it would be adding too much thickness and size on top of the hardware, so I pivoted to fabric, which is smaller, even thought still bulky, but can wrap and enclose the hardware nicely. When I tried to connect the two boards with bluetooth, Nikita found out the ESP-NOW library was removed from M5Stack, so we had to find the other way. Luckily there was an alternative that worked. Right now the two bracelets work well within the range of 10m using bluetooth connection, but they are not capable for long distance right now. For the future development, I would send the signals through Wifi to remote control them.
